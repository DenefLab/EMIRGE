This script takes the sequence IDs selected from the blast output 
and finds them in the original query fasta file.  
It then creates a new fasta file containing just the desired sequences.

The format for typing into the terminal is:

$ python fetch_fastas_with_seqIDs.py idfile fastafile outputfile

where 	fetch_fastas_with_seqIDs.py is the path to this script
		idfile  is the file with \n separated seqIDs
		fastafile is the fasta file containing all the seqIDs
		outputfile is the new fasta file the script generates
