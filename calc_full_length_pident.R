# RRR 8-25-15 wrote
# RRR 1/12/16 split into two separate scripts

# This script caclulates the full-length query's percent ID (BLAST may leave gaps at the ends).
# This script generates a new blast output table that has this "full length" pident in it.
# This script calculates which blast hit number was best after correction to "full length"
# The generated table feeds into two scripts: filter_seqIDs_by_pident.R and plot_blast_hit_stats.R 

# The script is called from the command line with the following 2 arguments in order:
# 1st		the path to the formatted blast file. This is the otus.taxonomy.blast.table file from step 3
# 2nd		the path the to file you are creating. This is the otus.taxonomy.blast.table.modified file
#       that contains the blast table with full length pident calculated and which hit was best specified.
#       This is used later both to filter the seqIDs based on their full length pident, in filter_seqIDs_by_pident.R
#       and to examine the appropriateness of the blast setting in plot_blast_hit_stats.R
# Example syntax in terminal:
# Rscript scriptname.R blastfilename outputfilename

# The format of the blast table is -outfmt "6 qseqid pident length qlen qstart qend" 
# The format of the output file is very similar to the blast.table file: tab delimited and no column names, 
# but the columns are qseqid, pident, length, qlen, q.align, true.pids, hit.num.best.ids
