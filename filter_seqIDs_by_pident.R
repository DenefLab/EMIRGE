# RRR 8-25-15 wrote script
# RRR 1/12/16 split script into two scripts- this and calc_full_length_pident.R

# This script generates a \n separated file of OTU (query) sequence IDs.
# The user specifies if they want seqIDs >= cutoff (TRUE), or seqIDs < cutoff (FALSE)
# The output of this script can be fed into the fetch_fastas_with_seqIDs.py python script (step 7).

# The script is called from the command line with the following 4 arguments in order:
# 1st		the path to the reformatted blast file. This is the otus.taxonomy.blast.table.modified file
#       that is like the blast output table with the calculated full length pident included
# 2nd		the path the to file you are creating. This is the list of sequence ID's matching your criteria.
# 3rd		the cutoff percent identity to use. Note the cutoff is applied to the calculated "full length" percent identity
# 4th		want matches? TRUE or FALSE. TRUE: return seqID's >= cutoff, FALSE: return seqID's < cutoff
# Example syntax in terminal:
# Rscript scriptname.R blastfilename outputfilename cutoff# TRUE/FALSE

# The format of the blast file is qseqid, pident, length, qlen, q.align, true.pids, hit.num.best.ids
# The format of the output file is \n separated qseqids
